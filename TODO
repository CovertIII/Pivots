change the way the way the game logic works.
Create a new structure for the level, put all the info about the level in the class and all functions that act on it not related to the game logic.
Example:
pv_gm_logic
	public:
		render
		keyboard
		keyboard
		mouse
		load_level
	pivate
		pv_lvl lvl;
		request_pivot
		request_move
		pick_drop

pv_lvl
	start
	end
	cursor
	line_num
	line[50]
	pivot_num
	pivot[50]
	turn
	
Game logic will handle keyboard input, etc.  like the pveditor does now.
